A simple web-based tool that automatically increases the views on a given URL at regular intervals by simulating real user hits. The tool opens the specified URL in a new tab, holds it open for 10 seconds, and then closes the tab, repeating the process every 5 seconds.

## ✨ Key Features

-   🔁 **Auto Hits Every 15 Seconds**: Boost URL views effortlessly.
-   🔢 **Live Hit Counter**: Track how many times the URL is visited.
-   ⏲️ **Countdown Timer**: See when the next hit will happen.
-   🛑 **Start/Stop**: Dynamically control the process with a single click.
-   📐 **MVC Architecture**: Clean, scalable codebase.

## 💡 How to Use

1. **Enter URL** → 2. **Start** → 3. **Watch the hits increase!**

Stop anytime, and the hit counter resets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **EJS** for the backend.
-   **HTML/CSS** for the frontend.
-   **MVC Architecture** for maintainability.

## 🚀 How It Works

-   The application simulates a real user visit by opening the given URL in a new tab and keeping it open for 15 seconds.
-   After each visit, the hit counter is updated, and the process repeats every 15 seconds.
-   You can stop the process at any time, and the hit counter, URL, and countdown timer are reset.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

-   🔐 **User Authentication**: Allow users to log in and track their URLs.
-   🌐 **Multiple URL Support**: Increase views for multiple URLs simultaneously.
-   ⏲️ **Custom Time Intervals**: Allow users to set custom intervals between hits.
-   📊 **Advanced Analytics**: Provide detailed statistics and metrics for each URL.
